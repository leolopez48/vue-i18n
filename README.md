# Multilingual app (i18n) + Vue 3 + Vuelidate

This app is an excercise by making an app with Vue 3 and the internalization language.

## i18n support

- Vuelidate: All the messages supported for this library were translated for a better user experience when using a form.

- Texts: All the text of the app can be translated, the only requirement is to add the value to the JSON.
